HTML
    comments in html are in <!-- -->

class attribute
    This attribute is given the name of the class that is defined 
    either in the same HTML document itself using the <style></style>
    tag or in the CSS files of your webpage using a period followed
    by the name of the class (e.g. .myClass{} ) These classes can be used
    across several different HTML elements and by a JavaScript document
    and all instances of the class will follow the styling defined by the
    corresponding CSS file.

id attribute
    specifies a unique ID for a specific HTML element, you cannot have more
    than one element with the same ID. In the HTMl doc, the ID points to a
    specific styling in a style sheet, or CSS file. In Javascript, the ID is
    used to manipulate the HTML element with that specific ID. The ID is
    declared in your style sheets using the format (#myID{})
    
<nav></nav> tag is used to represent a section containing
    navigation links to items in the same page or to other pages.
    (i.e. menu, table of contents, indeces, etc.)

<div></div> tag
    is just like a container and is used to encapsulate
    page elements. Divides the HTML Doc into sections

<a></a> tag
    or anchor tag defines a hyperlink that links one page
    to another page, webpage, file, location, or url. The href
    attribute of the <a></a> is assigned the name of the destination.


CSS
    comments in CSS are in /* */

@media rule
    This rule was introduced to define different styles for different
    media types. You can set one for printers, one for computer screens,
    and one for handheld devices. 

    The media query is written as: 
    @media not|only mediatype and (expressions) {
    CSS-Code;
    This applies the corresponding style sheet or rules if the query returns
    true given the expressions. The 'not' and 'only' operators are optional
    if using the 'all' media type.
    
    Other media types are:
    print - for printers
    screen - computer screens, tablets, smartphones, etc.
    speech -  for screenreaders that "read out loud"

margin, border, and padding
    visually the order of these attributes starting from the outside and moving
    your way inwards to the content is:
    margin, border, padding, content
    
}
